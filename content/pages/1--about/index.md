title: About

This is my personal piece of internet space which I will be using as a blog. Most of the articles here will be about topics I meet during my profession such as:

* Project management
* Front-end technologies
* Product design
* Game design

Remember that these articles are written from my narrow point of view. Instead of getting offended I would like to get to know your point of view.

I would be sharing my opinions here with the aim to spark conversations about these topics and hopefully we can learn a thing or two from each otherâ€™s experiences.
