We all have been there, it’s just something that happens. Our Inspiration runs out and we have no clue how to reel it back to us; Programmers struggling to structure their classes for reusability, Brand designers unable to set their client’s image apart from the competitors, UI/UX developers stressed out because users cannot seem to complete basic tasks using the new software, even though they followed all standards and usability guidelines. Sometimes we really need inspiration to hit us hard in the gut and linger there a while for us to make something out of it. 

There are however some ways in which we can help put ourselves in the right mind-set to innovate and come up with creative ideas.    

##Ways to stay creative 

1.	__Got an idea?__ A better way to refactor your uselessly long function? Write it down. Ideas might hit you at the most unconventional of places so be on the lookout and don’t let any pass you by without immortalizing them on paper, smartphone or other writing material. Window fog in cars is an awesome medium for releasing ideas whilst stuck in traffic. (Plus you get to witness the confused looks of fellow drivers).

2.	__Get motivation from other people.__ Use Social media to start following creative people that are influencing your area of expertise in addition to sport stars, models and celebrities with excessive lifestyles.

3.	__Break your routine.__ Doing the same things over and over can dull your mind. Mix it up and do things a little different. You will discover things that you will not otherwise. 

4.	__Do exercise.__ A healthy body is a healthy mind.  Run around the block, ride a bike to work, do pushups in the office; anything to get your blood pumping.

5.	__Finish small tasks.__ The human mind is a persistent idiot. It refuses to temporary forget about stuff that you have to do.  Un-clutter your mind of unfinished business so you can think more clearly.

6.	__Listen to music.__ It can alter your mood, make you dance uncontrollably and spawn ideas from the seamless void. Music is a powerful tool, but remember that absolute silence can be as effective. 

7.	__Reorder your working space.__ Changing the layout of your desk will help you see things from a different perspective. In Photoshop we flip the canvas to trick the brain into thinking that it’s the first time seeing the image; in real life it’s a bit more time consuming than that.

8.	__Experiment.__ Try new technologies, learn new languages, try out new code design patterns, new drawing techniques.  Discover new ways how to do your work.

9.	__Talk to people.__ Bounce your ideas with your coworkers and see what they have to say. Your idea might inspire others, generating even more ideas. Help create an energetic environment where fantastic ideas can flow freely. Conferences are also a great way to meet individuals that are as enthusiastic as you are on certain subjects. 

10.	__Get away from the monitor.__ Our work usually slave us to the chair and keyboard, but working on the same task for long hours will tunnel your vision. Countless times have I seen developers struggling for countless hours with a bug, only to fix it within minutes the day after.  Quit beating yourself up, step back from your desk, relax, refresh your mind and ideas are more likely to follow. 

11.	__Practice, practice, practice.__ Practice ALOT.  This reduces the amount of brain power needed to use the tools of your trade and let you focus more of expressing yourself with said tools. The computer mouse should feel like an extension of your arm, your graphics tablet should read your mind and pro Starcraft players should envy your quickness with a keyboard. 

12.	__Take risks.__ Let management worry about the consequences.  If you follow others and do only what is already proven to work will restrain your potential and limit your brilliance. P.S. Just to be clear, notify management of any mayor risky decision you take on a project; most of the time management will be able to assess the situation better than yourself.

13.	__Break the damn rules.__ Not all of them obviously. Crossing a busy road when the pelican crossing is showing a red man standing might make the rebel inside you rejoice a bit, but most of the people will consider that as an utterly useless risk. Learn your area of expertise but do not limit yourself by borders set by others before you. The world of computers has a habit of reinventing itself every couple years. Best practices that were valid 4 years ago might be irrelevant today. If the rules are hindering your work, shift-del them to oblivion. 

14.	__Put your skills to use and build something.__ Iterate on finished products rather than continuously developing an idea without ever releasing it for the general public. Show your work and get feedback. You will learn along the way and the next endeavor will be better than the one before it.

Different things work for different people. Not all of the above are relevant to everyone and what sparks my imagination might bore you to sleep. However having fun doing what you like is an important catalyst for great creative ideas. Explore the science of creating a controlled chaotic place for yourself where you can be equally creative and productive. Discover what works for you and impress yourself.
