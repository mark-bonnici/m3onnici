Once in a while the stars seem to align and a group of developers that function well together end up in the same team. They enjoy each other’s company, brain’s sync fast during peer programming, they challenge each other, and moral is good. The product team is happy because new features are getting pumped out like crazy. 

This can be loosely described as a Hyper-performing team and the good news is that there is no need to wait for any stars to align. Development teams can be cultivated into such a state and we will be exploring some of the strategies to reach hyper-performance.

> We define Hyper-Productivity here at 400% higher velocity than average waterfall team velocity with correspondingly higher quality. The best Scrum teams in the world average 75% gains over the velocity of waterfall teams with much higher quality, customer satisfaction, and developer experience. - __Jeff Sutherland__ (one of the inventors of the Scrum software development process)

## Forming the Team.
Understand that the team is only fast as the slowest member. Like a slow tire will impede you from reaching the final destination of your cute little road trip, so can an unmotivated developer. Learn what motivate them, preferred tech stack and offer your full _active_ support. Telling them that you are there for them does not work. You need to strike meaningful conversations and take actions based on what you learn.  

Several studies show that complementing personalities function better together. Simple online tests like [INFJ Personaility](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) can help you make more informed decisions when hiring a new developer. Learn to consider personalities in addition to technical knowhow when adding additional members, after all we are humans with flaws, preferences and weirdness. 

For example; Seating a developer that function better when consuming pistachios and other crunchy food next to a person with [Misophonia](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia) is inviting trouble.  

## Broadcasting the goal
The Goal has to be something that is easily remembered, specific and gives the team an achievable vision. Try to nail down deliverables from the get-go and get out of the way. Remember that you hired professionals that are passionate and experts in their field. Do not try to impose tech choices and frameworks, even if the team thinks that the project will be best served if its coded in LOLCODE or some other ridiculous [programming language](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/10-most-bizarre-programming-languages-ever-created--net-2412).

>The vision should communicate the essence of the future product in a concise manner and describe a shared goal that provides direction but is broad enough to facilitate creativity. - __Roman Pichler__

As long as the project is on route and the goal in sight, you should let them surprise you. Do not be that person to hire people, and then make it your mission to prohibit them from working. 
Communicate the goal, get everyone on board and unleash the hounds.

## A sense of belonging
Lack of purpose is a recipe for discouragement. This is true in both life and job. Purpose is one of the most fundamental human needs and without it we lose our drive and motivation.  

>I've seen it over and over, what people want from their careers are things that help them boost purpose in their lives. - __Aaron Hurs__

Alienating team members by having them work on projects by themselves removes the sense of belonging and any form of shared purpose the team had started to cultivate. Superheroes and lone wolves might be cool on the big screen but in the business world this is less than ideal. The culture of rewarding one person out of a team is also destructive. A team should fail and succeed as a unit. 
This way the bond between team members is strengthened, members feel like they belong, and a shared purpose is obtained.   

## Remove the blinders
Before starting working on a task, before writing the first line of code, take a step back. The picture is much clearer when your nose is not touching the canvas. For most of developers I worked with, all problems can be solved with code, after all for a man with a hammer every problem is a nail. Whoever thinks that over-engineering is a rare occurrence, should spend a day with a software development team. 

Before starting hammering at your keyboard, ask if the function being written is really needed. Did someone else solved this problem before? Are there any third-party software you can use? And even when the decision is to write code; learn to get the functionality ‘right’ before ‘good’. Don’t waste time on refactoring unless you are sure the feature will be released. To help ensure this, try to place stories which enhance the usability and performance of the application in a separate story. You will be amazed how many tasks can be solved without pushing any code. 

Apart from freeing time to work on more pressing matters, code that is not written does not require maintenance. Keep this in mind when you think about writing a factory to generate web forms in an application that needs only a contact us form; or writing your own generic tooltip component when one can be easily found online; or coming up with your own algorithm to solve the shortest path between two nodes.       

## Get help
The support and trust of management is invaluable. Do not be afraid to directly involve the dev team. Do not be over-protective of your team. The only protection happening should be protection from interruption, not information. If you see someone about to interrupt your developers when their thought train is going strong, be prepared to rugby tackle them. It is named SCRUM for a reason…Ok, maybe before tackling anyone you should consider other options to make the office a safe haven for ideas to flow while keeping interruptions to a minimum.

Another way to help achieve hyper-productivity is to be equipped with knowledge about all areas of the project and be ready to answer questions that rise during development. The longer the answer takes to be delivered, the longer developers are blocked. A good metric to aim for is that 85% of the team’s queries should be answered in 15 minutes or less. You’ll quickly realise that to accomplish this, requires co-location with the team. Leaders which are not present cannot help.
